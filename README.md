# Roman-Numerals-Converter

##### Introduction

I have just begun my path of learning the python programming language as part of the INFO1110: Introduction to Computer Science course I am taking at my University. I've read that the best way to learn truly python is to break out of the tutorial hell and attempt independent projects without any brief so this is my first attempt at creating an indepedent project.

##### Project Description

The project *roman_numeral_converter.py* is a simple converter for converting Roman Numerals to Arabic Numerals or Arabic Numerals to Roman Numerals.

As it is a first attempt the code isn't as streamlined as I would like it to be. I tried to shorten one of the functions but with the limited experience that I currently have I couldn't get it any lower than 27 lines.

Thanks for reading ðŸ˜ƒ
